# GroceryListGenerator
Collaborated with 3 team members to engineer a website that takes a link as input from allrecipes.com and outputs a formatted grocery list using string parsing.  Utilized the Beautiful Soup library to web scrape ingredients with Python and focused on system design to connect with Flask web framework to render the website.
